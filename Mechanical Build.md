# Mechanical Build
Here is the mechanical portion of the build! I found this part to be really fun and satisfying to see all the parts I ordered online and made as well as the plans that I had looked at culminate into a fully grown rover. I didn't learn many new skills from this portion as it really was just fastening screws, but I can tell you every possible way to use an Allen Key now! <br>
## Head Assembly
The Head assembly was definitely the simplest part of this build with only a few pieces to assemble together. However, after putting the RGB matrix head on the first piece of the body, i started to see the rover come to life!<br>

First step was to attach the PVC clamping hub which I 3D printed to the top piece of the body.<br>

Then, I attached the RGB matrix to the 3D printed matrix holder and attached that to the clamping hub. <br>

## Wheel, Drive, and Corner Motors Assembly

The first step for this was to drill two holes into each of the wheels so that I could attach a d-shaft clamping hub to the wheel so that it will rotate with the motor. <br>

After that, it was time to actually assemble the holder for the motor itself. Becuase the two U-channels that it was attached to were two different brands, one using the metric system the other using the imperial system, they had to be connected with an adapter, which weren't easy to screw together. <br>

This image shows the motor attached inside of the U-channel holder I assembled above.

Finally, for all of the motors I connected the C-shaped U-channel which I built before to the adapter of the motor holder. Now all 6 drive motors are finished!<br>

Next up were the corner motors, which required multiple pieces that I had to manufacture. Most notably being the pillow bearing block which I laser cut at school and inserted bearings I bought offline. To my surprise these performed even better than I expected them to.<br>

I also had to attach the corner encoders to a gear that would spin as the motor itself spun. These encoders prevented the corner assembly from crashing into the rest of the rover. <br>

## Rocker Bogie Suspension
The Rocker Bogie System is probably the most essential part of the rover. It's what gives the rover the flexibility and maneueverability it needs in order to climb up and down obstacles. Without it, the rover wouldn't be able to do what it's intended to do. <br>
![IMG_1840](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/ea71a15e-d5cf-43a0-84d3-e4dce8137c2a)<br>
I first connected the u channel to patterned plates and another U-Channel for the basic structure of the Rocker Bogie System.<br>
![IMG_1846](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/5d38a3fe-843e-413e-9490-b73176cf782c)<br>
This image is the most critical part of the rocker bogie system. With the aluminum tube attached to a rotational joint at the cross section of hte two U-Channels, the rover is able to move one side up while keeping the other side down, giving it the suspension it needs. <br>
![IMG-1844](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/638d0cea-2224-48ee-b836-2dde2eefd86a)<br>
Here is the assembled rocker bogie system without the wheels attached. You can see the clear difference in height between one side and the other. Also note the difference in height between the middle wheel and the outside wheels.<br>
![IMG_1868](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/5727a649-3dbe-4746-abd9-e293864bd7b0)<br>
Here's an image of the full rocker bogie suspension with the wheels attached! I even added the corner steering to the ends of the rockers. <br>
## Differential Pivot
Another critical part of the rover is the differential pivot connecting the two rocker bogies. This allows for equal and opposite amount of rotation on either end of the rover giving it fluid movement.<br>
![IMG_1854](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/71c5dad9-c517-4c2e-b017-a352b62320fc)<br>
This first part of the differential pivot connects to the center of the body, and is where the actual "pivot" occurrs. <br>
![IMG_1853](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/e19a89b8-c9f0-4106-ad81-1e1f6d23d73d)<br>
In order to attach the pivot joint to the rockers, I needed to cut holes in the aluminum tube to screw the RC turnbuckles into.<br>
![IMG_1856](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/6ce0220d-dedc-4a9c-b580-51fff6b00b33)<br>
Here the RC turbuckles are attached to the aluminium tubing. <br>
![IMG_1857](https://github.com/Hunter-Rohovit/Rubik-s-Cube-Simulator/assets/105554281/1a929e6e-5ef6-4a40-8a56-260317930cff)<br>
Once all three of those pieces from above are fastened together we have a complete differential mechanism that is ready to attach to the rover. <br>
## Mechanical Integration
After finishing all of the pieces from above it was time to finally put them all together! I attached the rockers to the side of the body and inserted an aluminum tube through which connected the system together. Then I added the the differential pivot to the top of the body and attached the turnbuckles to the rockers. Now it finally looks like a real Mars Rover!<br>
