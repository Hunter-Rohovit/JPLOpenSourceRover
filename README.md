# README
Here is my own community build of JPL's Open Source Rover! ([link to open source repository here](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/tree/v3.0.0)) A project that began two years ago has culminated into an experience of troubleshooting, innovation, and most importantly learning. I learned many new skills along the way, which have helped me grow more confident as a maker and utilize the tools around me to the most of their potential. From building my own parts that were discontinued to debugging electrical issues, it was not a simple, linear process, but thanks to the online Slack and GitHub community, I was able to recieve help when I needed it the most!
