# Part Manufacturing
By far one of the biggest challenges in this project was dealing with low stock of parts and even discontinued parts. In order to overcome this I had to bring out my creativity and use the resources around me in order to obtain all the parts. I started off simply by contacting suppliers about stock quantities and when that didn't go successfully I reached out to the Github Community who gave ideas. They showed me the CAD files for some of the parts, which I ended up 3D printing and gave me some suggestions about what to do for other parts. But with no ideas for the Pillow Bearing Block that was discontinued I took it upon myself to make my own part. Looking at the schematics online I created a dxf file to be laser cut at my high school and bought half inch bearings from amazon to insert into the blocks. After that I had all the parts I needed!<br>

# Laser Cutting

## Heat Inserts
One of the coolest techniques I learned from this project was the use of heat inserts when dealing with 3D prints. They allow for a good threaded screw to be added, which is often difficult to do with plastic parts. I used these heat inserts for my Falcon 9 Landing Legs project and they helped tremendously. <br>
