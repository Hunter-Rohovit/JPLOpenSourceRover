# Electrical Build
Here is the electrical portion of my Mars Rover! This was my first experience working with a large control board with several motor controllers, power distribution, and TTL communication. Learning how to solder, splice two wires together, and debug electrical components was a large part of the learning process during this stage of the build.
## Control Board / Soldering

These first two images show the difference between my first time soldering and my solder connections after some experience. Clearly, there is a big difference between the clumps of solder around the pins at the beginning compared to the cone like shapes towards the end. Some electrical issues I experienced later on were due to my poor soldering connections at the beginning, so I had to return and fix those. <br>
